# Vision to Velocity
This workshop is about helping organizations increase their _Engineering Velocity*_

> [!NOTE]
> _Engineering Velocity_ is exactly what McKinsey calls [Developer Velocity](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/developer-velocity-how-software-excellence-fuels-business-performance). I used the word _engineering_ because the idea applies to enterprise architects, infra engineers, QA engineers, and everyone else involed in delivering software.
